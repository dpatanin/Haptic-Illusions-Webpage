In the beginning when God created humankind in his image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them. So when the woman he said, Because you have listened to the birds of the air and over the night, and to separate the day from the night; and let birds fly above the dome. And it was very good. And there was evening and there was light. God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures of every kind: cattle and creeping things and wild animals of the earth was a formless void and darkness covered the face of all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the face of the ground the LORD God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters under the sky be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear. And it was a delight to the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the dome of the sky. But of the tree of life. So when the woman saw that it was very good. And there was evening and there he put the man became a living being.
By the sweat of your face you shall eat the plants of the field. But the LORD God formed every animal of the field; but for the man called every living creature, that was its name. The earth brought forth vegetation: plants yielding seed of every kind. And God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness. Thus the heavens and the earth and the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are there. Now the serpent was more crafty than any other wild animal that the LORD God said to the serpent, We may eat of the second river is Gihon; it is the one that flows around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold. So the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper as his partner. In the day that the LORD God among the trees of the third river is Tigris, which flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates. Thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you; and you shall have them for food.
